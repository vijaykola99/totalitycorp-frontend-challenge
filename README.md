# Brief Introduction

This is a cloned website of tesla home page built with react js. The page has simillar sections which made it to builed reusable components with react.

# My Approach

My approach consists of two reusable components, NavBar and HomePage. When you click the menu button, a sidebar is displayed. Click 'x-icon' to close the sidebar without disturbing the entire interface.

In order to render background images based on display width, I am using the 'windows.innerWidth' property. The innerWidth property returns the width of a window's content area.
To store the boolean value of sidebar status, I am using the useState Hook
